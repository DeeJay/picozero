Contributing
============

Contributions to picozero are welcome. Please keep in mind that picozero is 'lightweight'. It is designed to be easy to use but also needs to run on a microcontroller; please take this into account when considering feature requests or raising issues.

For more details, please see the following advice.

Status
------

As picozero is currently in Beta, pre-release 1.0, you should consider the following:

- The API is not yet set, however, this doesn't mean that backwards compatibility is not important! It is a balancing act.
- Requests for new features will need to be prioritised and responses to feature requests may take some time.
- Refactoring of the code base is very likely and, as a result, pull requests may need rework.
- Issues are likely to exist within the code base. Be kind!

Suggestions
-----------

If you have an idea for a new feature or would like to see a device included in picozero, please raise an `issue`_. Please explain your reasoning clearly.

Bugs 
----

Please raise an `issue`_ for any bugs found. Please include code examples and circuit diagrams if appropriate. 

Pull requests
-------------

All pull requests should be based on the `dev <https://github.com/RaspberryPiFoundation/picozero/tree/dev>`_ branch of picozero.
